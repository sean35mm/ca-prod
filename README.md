## Description

My wife, Iris Kwon, is an design/art director that has worked with top tech companies ie. Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, etc.. but she always felt restricted in those environments. We started her artist brand Child Appetite where she is able to use her own style and create things on her own terms. As of right now, we have a Shopify store at childappetite.com where I utilized Shopify's Liquid templating language to customize the theme. THIS repo is the making of the future website which will include a NFT Gallery and marketplace for her work.
